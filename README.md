Why did I make it look like this?
    While trying to keep the assignments display relevant, I wanted to bring in the Mini-challenge's design and bring a gradient look into my Portfolio.
I built this Project to help me get started with my Portfolio, it'll help me with my professioal career.
What makes my project stand out is it's creativity.
